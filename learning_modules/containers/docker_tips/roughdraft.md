# **Docker: Tips and Tricks**

## Making changes to the Dockerfile, building it, but changes aren't appearing when composing?

* Make sure that you are building with a tag (-t) (otherwise the built image's name is "\<none>") and that the docker-compose.yml file "`image:`" line or command in terminal is referring to that tag/name
    * *Note: Delete \<none> tagged images too, you may have many of them*

---

## Using Linux in a Docker container and `docker compose down` taking forever?
* Try `sudo shutdown now` or some shut off command before exiting the terminal/ssh session.

---

## Can't access files from inside of a container?
* Try using a `bind mount` within the docker-compose.yml file (or as part of the command when running the image as a container). Bind mounts are folders that are mounted onto the container as if it is actually a folder in the virtual machine. Any action in the folder, on either side (host or container) will replicate to the other side.
* Observe:

```yml
version: '0.0'
services:
    main:
        image: some-image-to-become-container
        build: .
        hostname: me
        volumes:
            - type: bind
                source: ./bindable
                target: /home/me/cs183
```
* The result in the container:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images\dockerbindshowimage.png" alt="Docker Container View">
</p>

* Or use this flag when running the container: `--mount type=bind,source=./bindable,target=/home/me/cs183`
    * Example: `docker run -d -it --mount type=bind,source=./bindable,target=/home/Username/bound imageName`

## Is your Bind Mount folder causing a "stat ... input/output error" ?
* This is most likely due to your Docker Daemon requiring a restart
<details>
<summary>Windows Instructions to Restart</summary>

1. Close Docker Desktop Application
2. Open Task Manager
3. End "Docker Desktop Service" task first
4. End all other "Docker Desktop" tasks
5. Reopen Docker Desktop

</details>

## On Windows and "Vmmem" service/task taking a lot of memory/cpu on your machine?
* The "Vmmem" service is the windows Virtualization service. This is what is containing your containers. If you want it to shut off, that requires turning the Docker Daemon completely off.

---

## Changes in a previous session of a Docker container not showing up in the next?
* When you `docker compose down` or delete a container, all your changes are reset to what the original image's save was. If you want your changes like an update to persist, don't delete the container (or use compose down) and simply shutoff/restart the container. (Note: unsure how this affects Docker Daemon, and if you can shut Docker Daemon off without losing information)

---

## Can't access your docker container after build?
* Whether it's an issue because SSH isn't working or otherwise, you have two options:
    1. You can use `docker attach <container name>` to "attach" the current terminal session to the container as root user
    2. You can open the Docker Desktop application and open a terminal as root user in the container using the GUI Button present on the container row.

---

## Container exiting immediately on run/compose?
1. Remember to use the `-d` flag when using the docker compose command (`docker compose up -d`). It detaches the container from the terminal session and runs the container in the background.
2. The main internal process of the container is ending. If this is the case, you can force the container to remain open by having the build of the image include at the bottom:
```docker
#On most Linux distibrutions you can use the following
CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
```
 * *Note: don't forget to rebuild the image after adding those two commands at the end*
3. If you don't want to rebuild the docker file, you can 
    1. Try this in the command line: `docker run -it imageName`
        * What the `-i` flag does is make your current terminal session interactive. In other words, it attaches the terminal to the container
        * The `-t` flag opens a channel similar to SSH to communicate to the container. But without the interactive flag, you won't be able to issue commands.
        * Effectively it's like running `docker attach` to the container you just created right after it's done being made
    2. Don't use the `-d` flag with `docker compose up`, the system will attempt to `docker attach` right after it's finished creating and running the container.
    * *Note: These two methods will mean that the container will exit immediately once you are done interacting with it.*

## `docker attach` command freezing your terminal?
1. If you're starting the container from the `run` command, there could be an error. Try adding in `--privileged` to enable privileged mode on the container. That could fix issues
2. If you're using the compose yml file, try including this into the options:
```yml
services:
    container:
        image: some-image-name
        otheroptions: blah blah blah
        stdin_open: true #Include this. Analogous to -i flag
        tty: true #Include this. Analogous to -t flag
```
3. It could be that your terminal is waiting for input before showing you anything. Try pressing any key, and see if afterwards it brings up text

---

## `docker attach` opening up login instead of straight into container?
* I don't totally understand why this happens, some containers do this, some don't. 
    1. To get past the login, I would recommend opening a terminal using the Docker Desktop Application which will give you root access so you can change the password
    2. Or you can attempt to set the root password earlier in the build, will require a rebuild of the container

---

## Can't exit/detach after using `docker attach`?
* There are escape keys that you can use. First input Ctrl+P, then Ctrl+Q. However if you're using Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal, VSC can catch those inputs first, and not relay them to the terminal.
    * I recommend using `docker attach` in it's own independent terminal
